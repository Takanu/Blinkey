# Blinkey
Blinkey is a small addon used to change the visibility of objects throughout a .blend file that matches user-defined filter criteria.  Each preset can have multiple categories which each have their own filter criteria, and for which the visibility can be controlled.

Both presets and categories can be created and configured using the addon preferences menu (when the addon is installed, a menu will appear under the entry of the addon in the User Preferences menu).

Currently you can use the current filters:
- Name-based filtering (search in the entire name, the prefix or suffix)
- Object type filtering (currently All, Armature or Mesh, will be adding more soon).

You can then control the visibility of all objects that meet the category criteria using the following shading modes:
- Solid
- Box-Bounds
- Wireframe
- Wire
- Texture
- Hide
